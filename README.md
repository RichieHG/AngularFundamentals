## Angular Architecture
* Modules
    * Contain routes, components, services and more
* Components
    * Contains a template, data, logic and forming part of a DOM tree
* Directives
    * Attach behaviour, extend or transform a particular element and its children.
* Routing
    * This, renders a component based on the URL state. Also, it drices the navigation
* Services
    * It's basically the Data layer. Contains logic that is not component related (sucha as API requests)
